    <description>Code editing.
Redefined.
Free. Open source. Runs everywhere.

Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity). 

## Features

* **Meet IntelliSense:** Go beyond syntax highlighting and autocomplete with IntelliSense, which provides smart completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules.
* **Print statement debugging is a thing of the past:** Debug code right from the editor. Launch or attach to your running apps and debug with break points, call stacks, and an interactive console.
* **Git commands built-in:** Working with Git has never been easier. Review diffs, stage files, and make commits right from the editor. Push and pull from any hosted Git service.
* **Extensible and customizable:** Want even more features? Install extensions to add new languages, themes, debuggers, and to connect to additional services. Extensions run in separate processes, ensuring they won't slow down your editor.
    
## Package Specific

The following package parameters can be set:
 * `/InstallationPath` - Where to unzip the package. Defaults to Chocolatey Tools folder.

These parameters can be passed to the installer with the use of `--package-parameters`.
For example: `--package-parameters "/InstallationPath:'C:\Users\User\Documents\VSCode "`.</description>
